# Super-Resolution-using-ConvNet
Reconstructing a high resolution photo-realistic image from its counterpart low resolution image has been a long challenging task in the fraternity of computer vision. This task becomes even more difficult when all you have is a single low resolution image as input to recreate its high resolution image.  This can be done using Convolution Neural Networks.
