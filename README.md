# Super-Resolution-using-ConvNet
Reconstructing a high resolution photo-realistic image from its counterpart low resolution image has been a long challenging task in the fraternity of computer vision. This task becomes even more difficult when all you have is a single low resolution image as input to recreate its high resolution image. 
This can be effectively done using Convolution Neural Networks.

This deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. The different network structures and parameter settings are explore to achieve tradeoffs between performance and speed. 
Moreover, the network is extended to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.
